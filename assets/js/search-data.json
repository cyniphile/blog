            "content": ". Note: I have never voted in a Presidential election, and am not registered as a member of any political party . “The 2020 election was so…2020”, that’s the tagline we’ve settled on as a nation. Joe Biden’s margin of victory was paper-thin in key states, often thinner than Trump’s margins last election. Of course, those 2016 results were widely claimed to be suspicious, which lead to an investigation that uncovered interference from (but debunked many widely alleged theories about direct collusion with) Russia. . Margin of Victory in Key States . &nbsp; 2020 2016 . Wisconsin | 0.62% | 0.82% | . Michigan | 2.73% | 0.24% | . Georgia | 0.29% | 5.32% | . Arizona | 0.35% | 3.78% | . Pennsylvania | 0.79% | 0.75% | . Data Source: New York Times Election Maps . This time it’s the same story, with the party tables turned and the focus on internal voter fraud. The Trump campaign has already filed several lawsuits in swing-states alleging election misconduct. Of course, anyone who’s spent time on social media has seen their share of people wondering aloud about the integrity of the election. Meanwhile the New York Times (along with other mainstream media) claims that next-to-zero fraud occurred (which is actually consistent with their 2016 views on the matter). . Given the focus on fraud, this election has been busy for hordes of indie data pundits (like me). Some are making Deep State connections to hacked election machines, often in connection to the so-called Hammer and Scorecard CIA election interference software that we’ve allegedly turned against ourselves. Others are just hunting for oddities and anomalies. One analyst made minor news when he raised over $200k via GoFundMe for investigating voting irregularities, only to have GoFundMe cancel his campaign citing that he was engaging in “attempts to spread misleading information.” . One data investigation that caught my eye in particular (and the eyes of many others) was that of Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai. He claims to have invented email1, ran as a Republican for US senator in MA (but lost in primaries), and has almost 200k YouTube subscribers. His latest hour-long video was about a case of possible election fraud in Michigan. . In the video, Ayyadurai outlines his team’s analysis of the Michigan counties of Oakland, Macomb, and Kent, where voting data behaves “as though an algorithm was there…that’s what we see here” . The video got a quarter-million views in less than 24 hours. Soon investing legend Michael Burry (Chrisian Bale’s character in The Big Short) was retweeting. . Consider these slides. Worth watching Shiva’s entire presentation for proper context, and deciding for yourself. #Election2020results are full of statistical anomalies that do not find easy explanation, but this is one possible explanation. #Question #Election2020 pic.twitter.com/3vpfZzqYUF . &mdash; Michael Burry MD (@michaeljburry) November 11, 2020 (He deleted these tweets soon after this article’s writing) . I was intrigued and went down the rabbit hole myself. To get an idea for Ayyadurai’s thesis, you can watch his video stating at 13:05, but I’ll also explain his setup below. . Straight Ticket Voting: An Electoral Oddity . Ayyadurai’s analysis centers around an odd aspect of Michigan voting: straight ticket (or straight party) voting. In a few states, Michigan one of them, you can skip voting for individual candidates for president, senate, congress, and other downballot offices. Instead, you can just check one box to vote for “The Democratic Party” (or “The Republican Party”), which automatically casts your votes to the Democrat (or Republican) candidates for every office on the ballot. It’s basically a “select all” option. . . Ayyadurai’s team created a data visualization by plotting the difference between the straight-ticket voting compared with the regular candidate-by-candidate voting (which I’ll refer to as “mixed-ticket”, since you can mix which parties you vote for when voting in this way). First, they organized precinct voting data as follows: . Precinct Straight Ticket Votes Overall Votes (Straight and Mixed Ticket) Difference, Overall vs Straight Ticket . precinct 1 | 60% Trump | 68% Trump | 8% | . precinct 2 | 50% Trump | 48% Trump | -2% | . For each precinct in a county, they show (2nd column from the left) what percentage of straight ticket votes went to Trump. Then they calculate how the overall vote went (3rd column from left), and finally look at the difference between the two. They visualize this data with a plot like so (here showing the example data from above): . . Their thesis is that the straight-ticket voting patterns should be similar to the overall voting patterns. So in a given precinct, if 60% of the straight-ticket votes were for Trump, Ayyadurai pretty reasonably theorizes that around 60% of the mixed party votes should also go to Trump, giving us a flat horizontal line in our plot. . However, when Ayyadurai looked at the actual data from several Michigan counties, he found something much different: a steep and highly significant downward trend, implying that the more Republican a precinct is, the more it tended to flip toward Biden. . It looks like his votes counts start getting linearly reduced and if you look at this curve and I’ve looked at lots of curves…anyone of us who’s in the pattern analysis business when you see this…you say something’s up. This is too structured, right? Too perfect. . He’s right: this level of trend is something that anyone who’s done data science usually loves to see: a very (very) strong correlation between two variables. . What’s going on? This puzzled me too at first. Perhaps it’s caused by “Romney Republicans” that don’t like Trump? Well, Ayyadurai has an answer to that too: if Republicans showed a distaste for Trump, we still ought to see a flat chart, just shifted down. Something else is going on, and for Ayyadurai, the only option left to consider is a malicious algorithm. . And remember we’ve talked about it the election systems…they have the feature of being able to manipulate vote counts from one person to another. It’s called a weighted race feature. . Why Are The Most Republican Precincts Flipping Toward Biden? . That problem is, he’s gotten slightly confused about what he’s looking at. We are NOT actually comparing precincts by “how Republican they are”. We are comparing straight-ticket results to overall results. This is a small but very important difference. Why? When someone goes to the polls in Michigan, they first choose to either vote straight-ticket or mixed-ticket. And they don’t pick randomly. This is what’s called a selection bias in data analysis. . The voters that show up to the polls and check the “all Democrats” or “all Republicans” box are, by definition, more partisan voters than the voters that decide to pick and choose between both parties. If a precinct’s straight-ticket votes (the votes from the most partisan voters in the area) go very Trump, then yes, you would expect the definitionally less partisan voters in the area (the mixed-ticket voters) to vote less strongly that way. . But won’t some Biden supporters switch to Trump too? Yes, but not as many, because in a very Republican area Trump would have more to lose and less to gain. Let’s go through a quick example. . Say a precinct has 1000 constituents: 800 Republican, 200 Democrat. If 10% of the Republicans decide to flip, Trump loses 80 votes. If 10% of the Democrats decide to flip, Trump gains 20 votes, for a net loss of 60 votes. Given the selection bias at work, most of these flipping voters are going to do a mixed-ticket vote…if you are a Republican that hates Trump, you probably still want to vote GOP for Senate, etc. . . Ayyadurai would say here, 60 votes got moved to Biden. But it’s actually just that mixed-ticket voters are less likely (by definition) to vote with precinct norms, and will tend to move overall results back towards the center. . All of this works the same way for more Democratic precincts; just do the same math but switch “Republican” and “Democrat”, and “Trump” and “Biden”. And if a precinct is split 50/50, there flipping votes net to zero. How does all this look on the precinct plots we’ve been looking at? . . It’s a nice downward sloping line. I’ve only done three data points, but you can see how the rest of the line fills in depending on how Republican or Democrat a precinct is. You can get a steeper line by increasing the percentage of mixed voters that flip (I used a rate of 20% in the example above), or shift the line up or down by making the flip percentage assymentical (e.g. 20% of Republicans flip, but only 10% of Democrats do). Add in some random variation, and this is exactly what we’re seeing in Dr. Shiva’s Michigan chart. It’s theoretically totally normal2. . Do Real Elections Actually Work This Way? . So we’ve got ourselves a theory about why these downward trends might exist, no fraud required. Let’s now do what Dr. Shiva didn’t do and look at more data. If our theory is right, we’d expect most counties to show this downward trend, and if Dr. Shiva’s is right, this downward trend should almost never appear. . Remember, only a few states do straight-ticket voting, and it turned out to be either quite a pain or impossible to get at their data. Ok.gov didn’t seem to work at all, much less have a detailed voting records API. Yikes. . Of course, we do know Michigan’s data is available, so lets take the first minimal step of verification Dr. Shiva didn’t bother to take: look at the same “suspicious” counties in the 2016 election, when Trump won Michigan. Is 2020 really an anomaly? Let’s look at Oakland county in 2016: . . It’s the same super statistically significant downward linear trend. It’s not as steep as in 2020, but still equally “suspicious” according to Ayyadurai’s theory. What about the following counties: . . Do these charts get your pattern researcher taste-buds salivating? Ready to take to the Twitters and yell fraud? Before you do, I should say this is data from Randoph, Jackson, Walker, Autauga, Geneva, and Fayette counties…in Alabama (2016 election)3. This is obviously not the first state that comes to mind when you think of election hacking targets; the state hasn’t voted for a Democrat president since Jimmy Carter in ‘76. . I admit, I cherry-picked some of the “worst” counties above, but the same trend holds throughout. Running Ayyadurai’s analysis on all Alabama counties in 2016, 70% of them showed a negative, statistically significant slope (in other words β &lt; 0 and p &lt; 0.05). In fact, only 13 of the 67 counties were “normal” by Dr. Shiva’s definition, showing no significant trend either way. . So…Now What? . Now we are at a crossroads. We’ve got a theory for why such patterns could exist completely legitimately, and the data shows these “suspicious” patterns seem to be the norm. . . I’d go with “there was no fraud” (at least of this kind). Dr. Shiva essentially cooked up a graph of “do mixed-party voters vote less partisan than fully partisan voters?” It’s almost a tautology, and if considered carefully, you’d expect a trend. I don’t know if my explanation is 100% correct, but it’s certainly much better supported by the data than Dr. Shiva’s theory that “trends are anomalous and signify fraud.” . Is Dr. Shiva lying to us then? Probably not. The selection bias he overlooked is easy to miss, and even the best data gurus out there make mistakes in identifying them. . Was Dr. Shiva doing good science and just happened to mess up? No, absolutely not. He and his team didn’t do even the most basic checks to support their theory, i.e. the checks I did above with 2016 election data (by myself in less than a day’s work). Even so, they decided to go ahead and claim there was a clear sign of fraud in Michigan, and publish this to their 200k trusting subscribers. Nothing could be more scientifically irresponsible, especially for a man that claims over and over again to be following the principles of science. Now I’m starting to wonder…did he really invent email? . Code and data used to generate this analysis can be found on Github. . 1. The invention of email is generally credited to Ray Tomlinson around 1970, though Ayyadurai does hold the first copyright to the term dated 1982.↩ . 2. A couple big assumption we are making here: 1) that the ratio of split-ticket/mixed-ticket votes is uncorrelated with a precinct&#39;s party leaning. 2) that the proportion of voters who flip is uncorrelated with a precinct&#39;s party leaning. If either assumption is violated in the right way, you could see flat graphs like Dr. Shiva is showing. Ultimately, we simply need to look to the data to see if graphs with lots of slope are the norm or not.↩ . 3. Alabama was the only state I could find with both straight-ticket voting and (sort of) readily available voting data. 2020 data was not yet available at the time of this writing. If you find more, let me know!↩ .",

            "title": "The Slant Fueling The Abortion War Must End",
            "content": ". Election time is upon us and abortion is both as important and as divisive as ever. The debate over Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barret to the Supreme Court revolved heavily around her probable pro-life1 stance. Meanwhile, in the first presidential debate, Joe Biden explicitly left open the possibility of packing the court in response. . Abortion comes with such a permissive license to righteous anger that most people avoid the festering topic. No wonder a Gallup poll indicates that in the past 25 years the American people have only gotten more divided on the issue, of late jittering around a 50-50 split between pro-life and pro-choice. Facebook feeds are crawling with memes about Bible-thumping, misogynistic white men, or organ harvesting Mengeles at Planned Parenthood. In the abortion debate, once you choose a side, the 150 million people in this country with the opposing view suddenly become some mix of stupid and Satan. . . Like all politics, the issue of abortion has suffered from the mainstream media polarization described so well in Matt Taibbi’s book Hate Inc. The book’s thesis is simple: hate sells. Rage is no longer just a toxic byproduct of our media; it’s the new unnatural life-blood. Now most publications have morphed from forums of fruitful public discourse into profitable echo chambers. . &quot;We live in a time of incredible political division... It’s become difficult to have an argument in the traditional sense. People with differing opinions are often no longer even working from the same commonly-accepted set of facts.&quot; https://t.co/PBREDO6vgd . &mdash; Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) September 19, 2020 Abortion is perhaps the ultimate case study of this communication breakdown. There’s no definitive answer to the issue’s fundamental question “when does a fetus become human?”, however abortion “debate” rarely goes so far as to discuss its own fundamental crux. This couldn’t have been illustrated more perfectly in the 2020 vice-presidential debate, with Kamala Harris proudly showing support for “for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body” while Mike Pence “couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life.” . Note that this missed connection comes with a district difference in terminology: “make a decision” vs “sanctity of life”. The abortion debate is riddled with such partisan wordplay that reflects each group’s very well-intentioned goals (women’s health vs fetal rights), but they also embody not-so-subtle digs at their opponents. It’s not even possible to reference the parties by name without stirring controversy. If you’re opposed to the “Pro-life” movement, as it calls itself, does that mean you are “not pro-life”? This sounds strange, and so the term “anti-abortion” is used instead, at least by detractors of the movement. By using one set of terminology you unmistakably identify your “side” and immediately either ingratiate yourself with, or aggravate, your audience. . For example this podcast in the New York Times: “An Anti-Abortion Leader on Trump’s Supreme Court Battle” (the title was later changed). A pro-life advocate couldn’t even get past the first two words of the title without feeling slant. . Being a data scientist, I decided to investigate usage of this slanted terminology in a more quantitative way. Knowing that certain terms like “right to life” or “reproductive rights” are almost exclusively partisan and rarely context-dependent, I decided to compile a list of such terms and do a mass search for them in thousands of recent abortion-related news articles (2732 to be exact). By assigning each slanted term a certain weight (“right-to-choose” slants pro-choice, “sanctity of life” slants pro-life) and counting them up, we can uncover which publications lean which way and how strongly. I made the results into an interactive plot below, where you can compare slant across publications and individual articles. You can also customize how terms are weighted based on your personal perception. If you have ideas for other partisan terms, post them in the comments below and I’ll try to add them to the visualization. While this setup is certainly simple2, it nonetheless provides a reasonable high-level picture of the bias extant in journalism today. . Few publications are balanced, and some of the most mainstream papers are very heavy on pro-choice rhetoric. For example, only 25% of articles from the New York Times used a net right-of-center word choice. The Washington Post was much more balanced, and the Bismarck Tribune (from pro-life North Dakota) was extremely right-leaning in its relatively small sample of articles (click on the “Scatter Plot” option to see individual articles). . While partisan writing might function as a call-to-arms for ideological battle, “ideological battle” is an oxymoronic term. The rational brain is suppressed in confrontation, making it almost physically impossible to change a person’s mind if they sense an attack. The “winner” of such a “battle” is just the one with that last word, not the one who spread his or her message successfully. Is it better to incrementally rally the troops to the polls, or to flip the vast mother-lode of votes in the opposition? . Take the mantra “my body, my choice”. It’s easy to chant and rings proudly of a struggle for individual freedom over the implied oppressive patriarchy. And it misses the point. “It’s not a choice, it’s a child” is the memorized pro-life rebuttal. The pro-life movement is not a cabal of men in Colonel Sanders attire meeting in secret cigar lounges to strategize the next move in white male world dominance. While the religious and traditional culture that is correlated with a pro-life stance is sometimes frustratingly sexist, it’s a causation fallacy to conclude such sexism is fundamental to being pro-life. According to the same Gallup Poll, 41% of women, 24% of Democrats, and 34% of those who “seldom or never” attend religious services self-describe as “pro-life”–substantial minorities. . But above all, attempts to “prove” that the pro-life movement is hatefully misogynistic are worse than useless: they are inflammatory. Ditto for the pro-life movement’s penchant for portraying pro-choicers as murderous eugenicists3 or irresponsible sluts. Humans generally believe themselves to be good people and hold their beliefs for what they perceive as good reasons. Declaring either side (tens of millions of Americans) to be stupid and evil is simplistic and displays a gross lack of empathy, a fundamental quality needed for effective debate and negotiation according to master negotiator Chris Voss. Conversion requires deep trust in the converter; it’s the only way to bypass the deeply instinctual fight-or-flight response that is normal when one’s basic ideals are challenged. . Not every abortion advocate is a screaming nihilist femmenismo with 6-inch gauge earrings (though alt-right Twitter is fond of portraying them as such). And they are not “anti-life” but pro-life with a focus on women’s health. The outcomes of abortion can be enormously beneficial both for women4 and their families (by avoiding the obvious physical, emotional, and economic trauma that go with both childbirth) and society at large. The cost is ending the existence of a pre-sentient being. Or at least usually pre-sentient. . Ultimately, the moral reasonableness of abortion goes up closer to conception, a fact that pro-lifers won’t admit. And the reasonableness of abortion goes down the closer to birth, a fact pro-choicers won’t admit. This idea of incrementalism was fairly, though crudely, expressed by Josh Zepps on the Joe Rogan podcast: . [abortion has] become so polarized in the United States that both positions are bullshit, and people on both sides know that both positions are bullshit. It’s bullshit to say that it is “just a women’s health issue and has no ethical implications whatsoever” even when it’s, as you say, about cutting a woman open at nine months and stabbing the embryo in the head5. It’s also bullshit to say that the instant an egg is fertilized, that is a person that should have all of the rights to life that an adult should have and that it’s murder kill a blastocyst that’s smaller than the size of the head of a pin. Both positions are stupid. This is an incremental situation. . . Polls show that nearly 60% of Americans are fine with first-trimester abortions, even though only 46% say they are pro-life. Conversely, only 13% of respondents thought that abortion should be legal in the last trimester. Intuitively, this makes sense: early on the fetus is tiny, doesn’t look that human, and most importantly, can’t feel pain until about 24 weeks gestation. It’s easy to see why pro-life rhetoric often revolves around late-term abortions, a favorite tack of Trump himself. . Biden and Democrats just clarified the fact that they are fully in favor of (very) LATE TERM ABORTION, right up until the time of birth, and beyond - which would be execution. Biden even endorsed the Governor of Virginia, who stated this clearly for all to hear. GET OUT &amp; VOTE!!! . &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2020 While only a small minority (around 1%) of abortions are later term (post 21 weeks gestation) and the practice is restricted in many states, abortions are indeed federally legal up to the moment of birth for any reason (a system much less restrictive than that of most European countries). Additionally, the vast majority of these later-term abortions are not for health reasons of the mother or fetus. While women seeking late-term abortions usually have understandable motives for not getting one sooner (such as lack of access, lack of money and insurance, or recent domestic abuse) this does not erase the fact that a life is being ended that is alarmingly human. Interviewed in a Science Vs podcast, one abortion doctor described the process of “dilation and extraction” (known as “partial-birth abortion” in pro-life lingo) in gory detail, and that “those posters that anti-abortion groups hold around abortion clinics [link possibly NSFW], those photos in them can actually be pretty accurate.” Is it really so crazy to be very uneasy with this? When is it right to inflict pain that you cannot feel, to stop a heart that is not yours, on an obviously human form? Is a big quality-of-life improvement a good enough reason? . For example, families that have children with disabilities can have an increased risk of divorce and increased financial struggle, and disabled children also put a huge financial load on their communities for special education programs and services. From an economic and quality of life perspective, it’s a no-brainer to “terminate” this burden. Now, most pro-choice folks agree “termination” after birth is not morally acceptable at all, but pro-lifers justifiably see the two cases as the same thing. After all, the only difference is a few inches out of the birth canal. . Given the intense moral quandary, is it really beneficial to the pro-choice movement (or even morally sound in general) to die on the hill of federally unrestricted late-term abortion? Conversely, should pro-lifers be willing to die on the hill of limiting access to early-term abortion? While many hold religious beliefs that life is sacred from conception, even if it is just a few cells, is that a reasonable belief to impose on society at large? Could early-term abortions be closer to “a sin that’s legal” like contraception6? . These are the questions that should be discussed instead of simply claiming moral high-ground a priori and then shaming our opponents for not doing so also. The resulting lack of trust has left us ramming legislation down each other’s throats to the beat of partisan power cycles, always pushing for as much as possible so that as much as possible remains after the other side gets its shot at claw-backs. . Remember, Galileo, “the father of modern science”, wasn’t imprisoned for simply advocating that the earth revolves around the sun, which was counter to Catholic teaching at the time. It was because the book he wrote on the subject used slanted language that offended the Pope, who quickly banned the book and put Galileo under house arrest. Only 400 years later did the Church finally admit fault. How much sooner could this have been resolved had Galileo been more tactful, even though he was right? . Likewise, if we drop contentious rhetoric and meme warfare from our abortion debate and adopt an atmosphere of trust via “steel man” argumentation, perhaps we could soon be in a state similar to Western Europe…where people aren’t screaming at each other about abortion nearly as much. . 1. Even using the term “pro-life” (instead of “anti-abortion”) can be seen as political and triggering. We’ll get to this in detail.↩ . 2. Data Notes. This is a visualization and is not meant to present scientific fact. As Henry Clay said, “Statistics are no substitute for judgment”. Data was sourced from ProQuest (via the New York Public Library) by doing a keyword search on US-based news articles that contained the word “abortion” at least twice, to filter out those that reference abortion only in passing (e.g. celebrity gossip). Some publications (e.g. Fox News, HuffPost) either are not in the ProQuest database or don’t provide access to full article text, so they aren’t represented in this dataset. I merged certain closely related publications under one label, e.g. New York Times and New York Times Magazine. Partisan terms were searched for using regular expressions, so &quot;pro life&quot; and &quot;Pro-life&quot;, etc. are all matched. Source code is available on Github. There are of course some cases where the usage of these slant terms does not reflect the author’s bias, for example when the author quotes someone else or when referenced organization names include slant terms (e.g. The National Right to Life Committee). This is a limitation of this type of analysis, but not, I think, a fatal one, as even these references still in some way present the rhetoric of the other side. ↩ . 3. Though it is true Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger supported eugenics, the vast majority of pro-choice advocates today most-likely would be strongly opposed to such ideas.↩ . 4. The pro-life camp often asserts there are a myriad of health risks that come with abortion, especially mental health risks, though there is little-to-no evidence to support this.↩ . 5. Fact check: the procedure for late-term abortion (dilation and extraction) does not actually involve cutting the women open, but it does involve puncturing the fetal head “using scissors or another sharp instrument”. ↩ . 6. In fact, &quot;Some prominent theologians, such as John Chrysostom and Thomas Sanchez, believed that post-quickening [late term] abortion was less sinful than deliberate contraception.&quot;↩ .",
